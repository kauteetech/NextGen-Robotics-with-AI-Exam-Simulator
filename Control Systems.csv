What is the primary function of a control system?,"To predict the future state of a system without any input.","To use an actuation input to change the behavior of a dynamical system.","To passively observe a system's evolution over time.","To model a system using mathematical equations without external influence.","B","A control system takes a dynamical system and applies an input, or actuation, to it. This input is used to change or control the system's behavior, directing it toward a desired state or response. This distinguishes it from a simple dynamical system, which is only observed as it evolves over time without external manipulation."																								
"What is a dynamical system as defined in the provided lecture notes?","A system that remains static over time.","A system that evolves over time.","A system that can only be described by a transfer function.","A system that has no inputs or outputs.","B","According to the lecture, a dynamical system is a system that evolves over time and is not static[cite: 2]. The lecture illustrates this with a pendulum, where its position and velocity change over time. This evolution can be observed, and its response can be measured."																								
"In the context of control systems, what is the purpose of mathematical modeling?","To find the single unique model for a system.","To create a set of equations that describe the system's dynamics for efficient analysis and design.","To observe a system's behavior without any external intervention.","To directly control a system using physical hardware.","B","Mathematical modeling is the process of creating a set of mathematical equations that describe the dynamics of a system[cite: 25]. This is done to make the analysis and design of control systems more efficient[cite: 32]. The lecture also notes that models are not unique and can be created using principles from physics like Newton's laws or Kirchhoff's laws[cite: 27, 29, 33]."																								
What is the key characteristic of a state-space model?,"It is only applicable to linear systems.","It uses a transfer function to model the system.","It describes the system using a minimum number of variables required to completely describe the system's state.","It only models a system in the frequency domain.","C","The state-space model is a time-domain model that uses a set of state variables. The lecture defines the state of the system as the minimum number of variables required to completely describe the system[cite: 83, 84]. This approach provides a comprehensive description of the system's internal dynamics and how they evolve over time."																								
"What do the matrices A, B, C, and D represent in a state-space model for a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system?","A is the input matrix, B is the system matrix, C is the output matrix, D is the feedforward matrix.","A is the system matrix, B is the input matrix, C is the output matrix, D is the feedforward matrix.","A, B, C, and D are all state vectors.","A is the Jacobian matrix, B is the observability matrix, C is the controllability matrix, and D is the identity matrix.","B","In the general form of a linear state-space model, the matrices are defined as follows: A is the system matrix, B is the input matrix, C is the output matrix, and D is the feedforward matrix[cite: 90, 91, 93, 155]. These matrices are crucial for defining the relationships between the state variables, inputs, and outputs of the system."																								
"What is the difference between a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system and a linear-time-varying (LTV) system?","LTI systems are always stable, while LTV systems are always unstable.","In LTI systems, the system matrices (A, B, C, D) are constant, while in LTV systems, they are functions of time.","LTI systems are modeled in the time domain, while LTV systems are modeled in the frequency domain.","LTV systems are always non-linear, while LTI systems are always linear.","B","The lecture explicitly shows the state-space equations for both LTI and LTV systems[cite: 156, 157, 159]. For an LTI system, the matrices A, B, C, and D are constant. For an LTV system, these matrices are functions of time, which means the system's dynamics change over time."																								
"When modeling a non-linear system like a pendulum, why is linearization often performed around an equilibrium point?","To solve the non-linear equations without approximation.","To obtain a linear approximation of the system that can be analyzed using LTI techniques.","To eliminate all non-linear terms in the system.","To make the system unstable for control purposes.","B","The lecture discusses linearization as a method to approximate non-linear systems around an equilibrium point[cite: 218]. This is done using a Taylor series expansion, where higher-order terms are neglected. The resulting linear model, represented by the Jacobian matrix, can then be analyzed using the well-established methods for linear systems, which simplifies analysis and control design."																								
"According to the lecture, what are the conditions for a linear system to be considered stable based on its eigenvalues?","The system is stable if at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part.","The system is stable if at least one eigenvalue has a negative real part.","The system is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts.","The system is stable if all eigenvalues are complex conjugates.","C","The lecture states that a linear system is stable if all eigenvalues of the system matrix (A) have negative real parts[cite: 234]. If even one eigenvalue has a positive real part, the system is considered unstable. This is a fundamental concept in stability analysis, as the eigenvalues determine how the system's state evolves over time."																								
"What is a 'limit cycle' in the context of non-linear systems?","A stable equilibrium point where the system state does not change.","An isolated periodic orbit that the system's trajectory converges to.","A trajectory that goes to infinity in finite time.","A linear oscillation that can be described by a sine wave.","B","A limit cycle is a phenomenon unique to non-linear systems[cite: 224]. It is defined as an isolated periodic orbit, meaning the system's trajectory eventually falls into a repeating pattern, or cycle, that is not an equilibrium point. The lecture provides the example of the Van der Pol oscillator to illustrate this concept."																								
"What is the definition of a controllable system?","A system where the state can be driven to the origin from any initial state.","A system where the output can be determined from the initial state and input.","A system where the initial state can be uniquely determined from the output and input.","A system where any initial state can be driven to any final state in a finite amount of time by a suitable input.","D","The lecture provides a formal definition of controllability[cite: 262]. A linear-time-invariant (LTI) system is controllable if, for any initial state and any final state, there exists an input signal that can drive the system from the initial state to the final state in a finite amount of time. The controllability matrix is used to check for this property."																								
"What is the 'observability' of an LTI system?","The ability to drive the system to a desired state.","The ability to reconstruct the initial state of the system from its output and input signals.","The ability to predict the future state of the system without any input.","The ability to measure all internal states of the system directly.","B","Observability is defined as the property of an LTI system where knowledge of the output and input signals over a finite time interval is enough to uniquely determine the initial state of the system[cite: 264]. The observability matrix, created from the C and A matrices, is used to check if a system has this property."																								
"What is the purpose of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller?","To provide a single control gain for the entire system.","To only use the current error to generate the control input.","To use the error, the integral of the error, and the derivative of the error to generate a control input for precise system control.","To linearize a non-linear system around an equilibrium point.","C","A PID controller combines three components: proportional, integral, and derivative[cite: 257]. The proportional component contributes to stability, the integral component helps with tracking and disturbance rejection, and the derivative component provides a fast response and is sensitive to noise. These three terms work together to provide a robust control input to a system."																								
"What is the 'vanishing gradient problem' and which type of model is it associated with?","A problem where the gradient becomes too large, leading to unstable training in linear models.","A problem where the gradient becomes too small, hindering the training of deep neural networks.","A problem in reinforcement learning where the reward signal is too sparse.","A problem in control systems where the state variables do not change over time.","B","The lecture mentions the vanishing gradient problem in the context of neural networks[cite: 212]. This is a common challenge in deep learning where the gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, causing the model to learn very slowly or stop learning altogether. This issue makes it difficult to train deep neural networks."																								
"According to the lecture, what is the Euler-Lagrange equation used for?","To solve linear algebraic equations.","To model the dynamics of a system, particularly non-linear ones, using kinetic and potential energy.","To find the eigenvalues of a system matrix.","To discretize a continuous-time system.","B","The lecture introduces the Lagrangian approach to modeling systems, which involves using the Euler-Lagrange equation[cite: 206, 207]. This method uses the system's kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V) to derive the equations of motion. It is particularly useful for modeling complex mechanical systems like a pendulum."																								
"What is the 'state-transition matrix' for a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system?","A matrix that converts a continuous-time system to a discrete-time system.","A matrix that describes how the system's state evolves over time from an initial state.","A matrix used to check the controllability of a system.","A matrix that is always equal to the identity matrix.","B","The state-transition matrix, denoted as e^(At), is a fundamental concept for solving LTI systems[cite: 229]. It describes how the system's state at time 't' is related to its initial state at time 't0'. It essentially provides the unforced solution to the system's differential equations and is computed using methods like infinite series, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, or Laplace transforms."																								
"In the context of stability analysis, what is the 'Indirect Method' or 'Lyapunov's Indirect Method'?","A method that directly checks if the eigenvalues of a system are negative.","A method that uses a Lyapunov function to determine stability without explicitly solving the system's equations.","A method that linearizes a non-linear system around an equilibrium point and checks the stability of the linearized system.","A method that uses phase-plane analysis to visualize system stability.","C","Lyapunov's Indirect Method, also known as linearization, is a method for analyzing the stability of a non-linear system[cite: 246]. It involves linearizing the system around an equilibrium point by using the Jacobian matrix and then checking the eigenvalues of the resulting linear system. If the eigenvalues have negative real parts, the original non-linear system is asymptotically stable around that equilibrium."																								
"What is the `Jacobian matrix` used for?","To calculate the total energy of a system.","To linearize a non-linear system.","To solve the state-space equations for a linear system.","To find the unique equilibrium point of a system.","B","The Jacobian matrix, which contains partial derivatives of the system's functions, is used to linearize a non-linear system around a specific point[cite: 218, 246]. This allows a complex non-linear system to be approximated as a simpler linear system for a local analysis of its behavior, particularly for stability studies."																								
"What is the 'Finite escape-time' phenomenon?","A situation where a system's state asymptotically approaches an equilibrium point.","A situation where the system's state remains bounded over time.","A phenomenon where a system's state goes to infinity in a finite amount of time.","A condition that only occurs in linear systems.","C","Finite escape-time is a phenomenon that can occur in non-linear systems[cite: 219]. It is a situation where the solution to the system's differential equations goes to infinity at a finite time, rather than approaching infinity as time goes to infinity. The lecture gives an example where the solution x(t) goes to infinity as t approaches a finite value t0."																								
"What is the definition of an `equilibrium point` for a system?","A point where the system's output is zero.","A point where the system's input is zero.","A point where the state of the system does not change over time.","A point where the system's eigenvalues are all negative.","C","An equilibrium point of a system is a state where, if the system starts there, it will remain there indefinitely[cite: 220]. Mathematically, for a system described by ẋ = f(x), an equilibrium point 'a' is where f(a) = 0. The lecture provides examples for both linear and non-linear systems, such as the pendulum having multiple equilibrium points."																								
"What is a key difference between open-loop and closed-loop control systems?","Open-loop systems use feedback from the system's output, while closed-loop systems do not.","Closed-loop systems use feedback from the system's output, while open-loop systems do not.","Open-loop systems are more complex and expensive.","Closed-loop systems are always unstable, while open-loop systems are always stable.","B","The lecture explains the difference between open-loop and closed-loop control systems[cite: 251, 253]. An open-loop system does not use feedback from the controlled output, relying on a pre-programmed input. In contrast, a closed-loop system uses feedback by measuring the output and comparing it to a reference, generating an error signal that is used to adjust the control input. This feedback mechanism allows closed-loop systems to be more robust to disturbances."																								
"In the context of the pendulum model, what is the key difference between using Newton's law and the Lagrangian approach?","Newton's law models the system using forces and torques, while the Lagrangian approach models it using energy.","Newton's law can only model linear systems, while the Lagrangian approach models non-linear systems.","The Lagrangian approach can only be used for systems with external inputs.","Newton's law models the system in the time domain, while the Lagrangian approach models it in the frequency domain.","A","The lecture shows two methods for modeling the pendulum: Newton's second law, which uses the sum of torques, and the Lagrangian approach, which uses the difference between kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V)[cite: 164, 170, 189]. Both methods arrive at the same differential equations of motion for the system, but they use different fundamental principles for their derivation."																								
Which of the following is an example of an open-loop control system mentioned in the lecture?,"An air conditioner.","A washing machine.","A human brain.","A refrigerator.","B","The lecture provides examples of both open-loop and closed-loop systems. The washing machine is cited as an example of an open-loop system, as it proceeds through its cycles based on a pre-set timer without measuring and reacting to the cleanliness of the clothes[cite: 251]. In contrast, an AC unit or a geyser are given as examples of closed-loop systems."																								
"What is the `Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)` used for?","To find the single best gain for a controller without considering performance or effort.","To find the optimal control gain (K) to achieve a trade-off between system performance and control effort.","To convert a non-linear system into a linear one.","To check the controllability of a system.","B","LQR is an optimal control method that aims to find a controller gain (K) that minimizes a user-defined cost function[cite: 270]. This cost function is typically a balance between achieving good performance (e.g., minimizing the error) and minimizing the control effort required. The solution involves solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) to find the optimal gain."																								
"What is the purpose of `Model Predictive Control (MPC)`?","To provide a pre-calculated control sequence for a system without any feedback.","To use a model to predict future system behavior and solve an optimization problem to find the optimal control sequence.","To only work with linear systems in the frequency domain.","To find a single constant gain for a controller.","B","Model Predictive Control (MPC) uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior over a finite time horizon[cite: 274, 275]. It then solves an optimization problem at each time step to find the optimal control input sequence for that horizon. The first control input in this sequence is applied to the system, and the process is repeated at the next time step. This approach is powerful because it can handle non-linear systems and constraints on inputs and states."																								
"What is the `pole-placement controller` used for?","To randomly assign eigenvalues to a system.","To place the system's poles (eigenvalues) at desired locations to achieve a specific behavior.","To calculate the state-transition matrix.","To check the observability of a system.","B","The goal of a pole-placement controller is to strategically place the poles (eigenvalues) of the closed-loop system at desired locations in the complex plane[cite: 266]. By changing the eigenvalues, we can modify the system's behavior, for example, making it more stable or faster-responding. This is done by designing a state-feedback control law, u = -Kx, where K is the gain matrix that needs to be calculated."																								
"What is a key trade-off when designing a pole-placement controller?","A trade-off between system performance and controllability.","A trade-off between system stability and observability.","A trade-off between the speed of response and the required control effort.","A trade-off between linearity and non-linearity.","C","The lecture highlights a crucial trade-off in pole-placement design[cite: 269]. Placing poles far to the left of the imaginary axis in the complex plane (i.e., giving them larger negative real parts) results in a faster-responding system. However, this often requires a larger control effort (larger gains). Conversely, placing poles closer to the imaginary axis leads to a more sluggish response with less control effort."																								
"What is the meaning of a `Hurwitz matrix` in the context of stability?","A matrix where all eigenvalues have positive real parts.","A matrix where all eigenvalues have negative real parts.","A matrix that is always symmetric and positive definite.","A matrix used for calculating the observability of a system.","B","The lecture defines a Hurwitz matrix as one where all of its eigenvalues have negative real parts[cite: 245]. This property is directly related to the stability of a linear system. A linear system is stable if and only if its system matrix (A) is Hurwitz."																								
"What does it mean for a function `V(x)` to be `radially unbounded` in Lyapunov's Direct Method?","V(x) is always positive.","V(x) is always negative.","V(x) is a function of time.","V(x) goes to infinity as the magnitude of x goes to infinity.","D","In Lyapunov's Direct Method, a radially unbounded function V(x) is a requirement for proving global asymptotic stability[cite: 240, 241]. It means that the value of the function V(x) grows without bound as the magnitude of the state vector x also grows without bound. This ensures that the Lyapunov function can enclose the entire state space."																								
"What is the difference between `stability` and `asymptotic stability` for a non-linear system?","Asymptotic stability requires the system to return to the equilibrium point, while stability only requires it to stay in a bounded region.","Asymptotic stability is a property of linear systems, while stability is a property of non-linear systems.","Stability requires the system to return to the origin, while asymptotic stability does not.","There is no difference between the two terms.","A","The lecture provides a generalized notion of stability for non-linear systems[cite: 238, 239]. An equilibrium is stable if, for a small initial disturbance, the system's state remains within a small bounded neighborhood. An equilibrium is asymptotically stable if it is also stable and the system's state eventually returns to the equilibrium point as time goes to infinity."																								
"According to the lecture, what is the `cost function` in optimal control used to define?","The initial state of the system.","The constraints on the system's dynamics.","A measure of performance and effort to be minimized.","The eigenvalues of the system matrix.","C","The cost function, or objective function, is a crucial part of optimal control[cite: 250, 270]. It is a mathematical expression that quantifies the desired performance of the system and the effort required to achieve it. The goal of the optimal control problem is to find a control input that minimizes this cost function, thereby finding the best balance between performance and effort."																								
"What is the main challenge of using an open-loop controller?","It is very expensive to implement.","It requires constant recalibration and is sensitive to disturbances.","It can only be used for linear systems.","It is difficult to design.","B","Open-loop controllers have several disadvantages, as noted in the lecture[cite: 253]. They are susceptible to disturbances, which can cause the output to drift from the desired value. They also require frequent recalibration to maintain accuracy, as they do not use feedback to correct for errors."																								
"The Leslie Population model is an example of what type of system?","A continuous-time system.","A linear discrete-time system.","A non-linear continuous-time system.","A hybrid system.","B","The lecture uses the Leslie Population model as an example of a linear discrete-time system[cite: 214, 216]. This model describes how a population, divided into different age groups, changes over discrete time periods (e.g., years), and its dynamics can be represented by a linear matrix equation, x(k+1) = A*x(k)."																								
"In the context of the spring-mass-damper system, what physical law is used to derive the equations of motion?","Kirchoff's law","Faraday's law","Newton's Second Law","Ohm's law","C","The lecture uses a spring-mass-damper system as an example to illustrate mathematical modeling[cite: 109]. To derive the equations of motion for this mechanical system, Newton's Second Law (ΣF = ma) is applied to a free-body diagram of the mass, considering the external force, spring force, and friction force."																								
"What is a `Phase Plane` used for in control systems analysis?","To find the eigenvalues of a system.","To analyze the stability of linear systems.","To analyze the behavior of non-linear systems by plotting their state variables against each other.","To discretize a continuous-time system.","C","A Phase Plane is a graphical tool used to analyze the behavior of dynamical systems, particularly non-linear ones[cite: 224]. It is a plot of one state variable against another, which allows for a visual understanding of the system's trajectory, stability, and phenomena like limit cycles."																								
"What is the key advantage of a `proportional controller` over a `bang-bang controller`?","A proportional controller provides a fast response, while a bang-bang controller is slow.","A proportional controller results in a smooth operation, while a bang-bang controller can be too aggressive and lead to overshooting.","A proportional controller is less expensive to implement.","A proportional controller can only be used for non-linear systems.","B","The lecture contrasts a bang-bang controller, which is very aggressive, with a proportional controller[cite: 255, 256]. A bang-bang controller switches between maximum positive and negative control inputs, which can be problematic and lead to overheating or overshooting. A proportional controller, on the other hand, generates a control input proportional to the error, resulting in a smoother, more controlled operation."																								
"According to the lecture, which of the following is NOT an advantage of a state-space controller over a classical controller (e.g., PID)?","It can accommodate input and state constraints.","It can be used with multiple loops.","It provides a control over the internal states of the system.","The gains do not need to be retuned if the system changes.","D","The lecture lists several advantages of state-space controllers, such as accommodating constraints and controlling internal states[cite: 259, 260]. However, the lecture also states that a drawback of PID controllers is that their gains need to be retuned if the system changes, but this is a characteristic of all controllers, including state-space controllers, not a distinguishing advantage. Therefore, it is not an advantage that a state-space controller's gains do not need to be retuned."																								
"What is the purpose of the `D` term in a PID controller?","To provide a slow response and help with disturbance rejection.","To contribute to stability and medium-rate response.","To provide a fast response and be sensitive to noise.","To ensure the steady-state error is zero.","C","The `D` term, or the derivative component, in a PID controller is responsible for the fast-rate of response[cite: 257]. It anticipates future error by looking at the rate of change of the current error. However, this also makes it very sensitive to noise in the system, which is a known drawback."																								
"What is a `discrete-time system`?","A system that is only defined by a transfer function.","A system where the state evolves continuously over time.","A system where the state changes only at discrete intervals of time.","A system that is always linear and time-invariant.","C","A discrete-time system is a system where the state is defined and changes only at discrete time steps, such as at `t = 0, 1, 2...`[cite: 214]. This is in contrast to a continuous-time system, where the state evolves continuously over time. The Leslie Population model is given as an example."																								
"How does the `Lagrangian approach` handle an external force or torque on a system?","It is ignored as the Lagrangian only deals with conservative forces.","It is added as a non-conservative term in the Euler-Lagrange equation.","It is subtracted from the potential energy term.","It is multiplied by the kinetic energy term.","B","The lecture demonstrates the use of the Euler-Lagrange equation for a pendulum without an external force[cite: 210]. However, a non-conservative external force or torque (like control torque τc) is added to the right side of the Euler-Lagrange equation. This is how the Lagrangian approach incorporates external inputs into the system dynamics."																								
"What does `chaos` refer to in the context of non-linear systems?","A state where the system's trajectory repeats itself perfectly.","A state where the system's trajectory is unstable and goes to infinity.","A state of irregular oscillation that never exactly repeats.","A state where the system's state remains at a single equilibrium point.","C","Chaos is a phenomenon unique to non-linear systems, characterized by irregular oscillations that never exactly repeat[cite: 225]. The lecture gives the Lorenz system, which models atmospheric convection, as a classic example of a chaotic system. This is different from a limit cycle, which is a periodic and repeating oscillation."																								
"What does the term `robustness` mean in control systems?","The ability of a system to achieve a desired output without any control input.","The ability of a system to remain stable despite disturbances and modeling errors.","The ability of a system to have a very fast response time.","The ability of a system to be perfectly linear.","B","The lecture defines robustness as the ability of a system to maintain stability and performance in the presence of disturbances and modeling errors[cite: 247]. It is a measure of how well a system can handle uncertainties. There is a trade-off between stability and robustness, as a system that is too stable might not respond to actual inputs."																								
"What is the main purpose of `discretization`?","To convert a non-linear system into a linear one.","To convert a continuous-time system into a discrete-time one for numerical analysis or digital control.","To find the equilibrium points of a system.","To linearize a system around an equilibrium point.","B","Discretization is the process of converting a continuous-time system into a discrete-time representation[cite: 216]. This is necessary for implementing control systems on digital computers, which can only process data at discrete time intervals. The lecture shows how a continuous-time system can be approximated as a discrete-time system using a small time step 'h'."																								
"What is a `positive definite matrix`?","A matrix where all eigenvalues are zero.","A symmetric matrix where all eigenvalues are greater than zero.","A matrix where the sum of all elements is positive.","A matrix where all eigenvalues are negative.","B","The lecture defines a positive definite matrix as a symmetric matrix where all of its eigenvalues are greater than zero[cite: 245]. This type of matrix is important in stability analysis using Lyapunov's method, as it is used to construct Lyapunov functions that are positive everywhere except at the origin."																								
"What is the `Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE)` used for?","To check the controllability of a system.","To find the optimal control gain for an LQR controller.","To solve the state-space model of a non-linear system.","To linearize a system using the Jacobian matrix.","B","The Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) is a key component of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) design[cite: 271]. Solving the ARE provides the matrix 'S', which is then used to calculate the optimal control gain 'K' that minimizes the LQR cost function. The lecture notes mention that MATLAB has a function `care` to solve this equation."																								
"In the context of the pendulum model, what is the 'bias' term?","The input torque.","The length of the pendulum rod.","The mass of the pendulum bob.","The gravitational force acting on the pendulum.","D","The bias term is not explicitly named as such, but the gravitational force (mg*l*sinθ) is a constant term in the pendulum's equation of motion that acts as a disturbance or bias[cite: 170]. This term is a function of the state (θ) and is always present, even without an external input or control torque, making it a critical component of the system's dynamics."																								
"What does it mean for a system to be `marginally stable`?","The system's state goes to infinity.","The system's state approaches zero over time.","The system's state remains in a bounded region but does not go to zero, with some eigenvalues having a real part of zero.","The system is asymptotically stable.","C","A marginally stable system is a special case of stability where the system's state does not go to zero, but it remains bounded[cite: 235]. This occurs when some of the eigenvalues of the system matrix (A) have a real part of zero. The lecture shows this with the example of a spring-mass system, where oscillations continue indefinitely without growing or decaying."																								
"Which of the following is a key advantage of `Model Predictive Control (MPC)`?","It guarantees a globally optimal solution.","It is very simple to implement and computationally inexpensive.","It can accommodate input and state constraints.","It does not require a mathematical model of the system.","C","The lecture lists several advantages of MPC, including its ability to handle non-linear systems, use optimization, and, importantly, account for input and state constraints[cite: 275]. This is a major strength of MPC compared to classical control methods like PID, which struggle with such constraints."																								
"What is the definition of `regulation` as a control objective?","To achieve a desired output value.","To handle changes in the set point of the system.","To compensate for external disturbances to maintain a constant output.","To minimize a user-defined cost function.","C","The lecture defines `regulation` as the control objective of compensating for external disturbances[cite: 249]. The goal is to maintain a constant output or state, even when faced with unexpected external influences. The example of a regulator is a voltage regulator, which maintains a constant output voltage despite fluctuations in the input voltage."																								
"What is the goal of `tracking` as a control objective?","To minimize the control effort.","To compensate for external disturbances.","To achieve a desired final state.","To handle changes in the set point or reference signal.","D","The lecture defines `tracking` as the control objective where the goal is to handle changes in the set point or reference signal[cite: 249]. The control system must ensure that the output of the system follows a changing reference signal. This is a common objective in robotics and other dynamic systems."																								
"Why are control engineers interested in placing the poles (eigenvalues) of a system's closed-loop transfer function?","To ensure the system is not controllable.","To ensure the system is not observable.","To modify the behavior of the system, such as its speed of response and stability.","To find the equilibrium points of the system.","C","The lecture establishes the connection between a system's eigenvalues and its behavior[cite: 260, 267]. The eigenvalues, also called poles, determine the stability and response characteristics of the system. By using state-feedback control, engineers can place these poles at desired locations in the complex plane to make the system more stable, faster, or achieve other performance objectives."																								
"What is the difference between `stability` and `robustness`?","Stability is the ability of a system to remain at an equilibrium, while robustness is its ability to handle disturbances.","Stability is a measure of the control effort, while robustness is a measure of the speed of response.","Stability is only for linear systems, while robustness is for non-linear systems.","There is no difference between stability and robustness.","A","The lecture differentiates between stability and robustness[cite: 247]. Stability is the fundamental property of a system to return to or remain near an equilibrium point. Robustness, on the other hand, is the system's ability to maintain that stability and performance in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. The lecture highlights that there is often a trade-off between the two, as a system that is too stable may not respond to actual inputs."																								
"According to the lecture, what is the main reason a human brain is a good example of a closed-loop control system?","It does not use feedback.","It uses a pre-set timer to perform tasks.","It takes an action, observes the result, and adjusts its actions based on the error.","It is an open-loop system.","C","The lecture uses the human brain as a good example of a closed-loop control system[cite: 253].
