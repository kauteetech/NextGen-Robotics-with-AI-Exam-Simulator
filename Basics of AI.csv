"Which of the following best defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) according to the lecture material?","The set of all tasks where a computer can make decisions based on data.","The field of study that focuses on human-interactive robotics.","The set of all tasks where a computer can make decisions (rule-based or data-driven).","A system that uses neural networks to make predictions.","C","Artificial Intelligence is defined as the set of all tasks in which a computer can make decisions, which can be either rule-based or data-driven. This is a broader definition compared to machine learning, which specifically focuses on data-driven decisions. The lecture differentiates between these two concepts, with AI being the more general term. [cite: 15]"
